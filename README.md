# GR Solver

This is a Python program that translates the *Mathematica* notebook **Curvature and the Einstein Equation** to a Python program. As of now, the plan is, from a given metric, it computes the components of the following:
- The inverse metric
- The Christoffel symbols
- The Riemann tensor
- The Ricci tensor
- The scalar curvature
- The Einstein tensor.

You must input the covariant components of the metric tensor by editing the relevant input. You may also wish to change the names of the coordinates. All the components computed are in the *coordinate basis* in which the metric was specified.
